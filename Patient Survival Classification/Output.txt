
We will decide the variables to be included based on their correlations with the Dependant Variable i.e. Death_Event and consider those features that have correlations greater than +/- 0.2

age                  0.253729
ejection_fraction   -0.268603
serum_creatinine     0.294278
DEATH_EVENT          1.000000
Name: DEATH_EVENT, dtype: float64

Based on these results, our independant variables will be: 

 1) Age 
 2) Ejection Fraction 
 3) Serum Creatinine

However, following facts and a fairly reasonable hunch, let's include Smoking as a feature too.
